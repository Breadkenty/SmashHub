        </p>

        <h2>Data Collected</h2>
        <p>
          We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we
          collect information when you create an account, subscribe, participate
          in any interactive features of our services, fill out a form, request
          customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of

          We collect anonymous data from every visitor of the Website to monitor
          traffic and fix bugs. For example, we collect information like web
          requests, the data sent in response to such requests, the Internet
          Protocol address, the browser type, the browser language, and a
          timestamp for the request. We also use various technologies to collect
          information, and this may include sending cookies to your computer.
          Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in your
          device memory that helps us to improve our services and your

          and count visits. We may also collect information using web beacons
          (also known as "tracking pixels"). Web beacons are electronic images
          that may be used in our services or emails and to track count visits
          or understand usage and campaign effectiveness. Our Privacy Policy was
