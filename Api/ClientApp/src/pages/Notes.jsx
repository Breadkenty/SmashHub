            Hi thanks for checking this app out! This app was created as my
            final project for Suncoast Developers Guild, a coding bootcamp in
            St.Petersburg FL.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hopes for this app is to make the process of learning a new
            character in Smash Bros Ultimate an enjoyable experience by easily
            having combos accessible with the help of the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any feedback is greatly appreciated as this app is a working
            progress. I hope this app will help you in the journey of learning a
            new character :)
          </p>
          <p>Love,</p> <p>Kento</p>
