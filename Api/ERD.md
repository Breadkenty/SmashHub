another combo for fox:

| Id  | ComboId | Input          | hold  |
| --- | ------- | -------------- | ----- |
| 1   | 2       | "forward-dash" | true  |
| 2   | 2       | "then"         | false |
| 3   | 2       | "dash-attack"  | false |
| 4   | 2       | "then"         | false |
| 5   | 2       | "up-tilt"      | false |
| 6   | 2       | "then"         | false |
| 5   | 2       | "up-tilt"      | false |
| 6   | 2       | "then"         | false |
| 5   | 2       | "up-tilt"      | false |
| 6   | 2       | "then"         | false |
| 7   | 2       | "up-smash"     | false |

The way these combos work is you have certain inputs where most are classified by the four directional inputs but in different categories.

For example, there are categories for tilts, throw, smash, special and directions for all of them. up and smash is up-smash, down and tilt is down-tilt, forward and dash is forward-dash, and so on. There are some exceptions where aerials and specials have extra inputs outside of the four directions. Like aerials have a neutral direction (when a user inputs no direction and just the single button while performing a jump), and Z button (when a use pressed the Z button with no directions while performing a jump).

These combos are then put together using a series of "and" and "then" sequences to show when you want to combine certain inputs together or move to another input.
